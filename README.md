#Summary
Throughout this academic year, I've gone through more technical interviews than I can count. The current structure of technical interviews (in my opinion) lends itself to a
bias that works against students and other interview candidates who already belong to traditionally underrepresented groups in tech. That is, for students who are from low income backgrounds
and must work (like myself) often multiple jobs at a time in addition to their schoolwork, finding adequate time to prepare for technical interviews can be difficult, if not impossible. And, that
narrative assumes that there are adequate resources to use for preparation. If you cannot afford to "just buy a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview," or one of many trumpeted resources for preparation,
the card are piled higher against you. Furthermore, when interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds are in an interview, it is my opinion that minor hiccups (due to nervousness or other reasons)
are magnified. While an interviewer might give the benefit of the doubt to a student from a "reputable" institution who runs out of time answering a question, my experience leads me to believe that a student
without the "qualification" of a Stanford or MIT on their resume would not be afforded the same.

In any case, many resources I've found to prepare for these interviews have been ambiguous. For that reason, I've included the most memorable questions I've encountered in this repo. Enjoy.
